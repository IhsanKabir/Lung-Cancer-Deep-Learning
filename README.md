# Methodology
#### Medical Imaging is an emerging sector that involves deep learning to detect or classify objects significant to medical understanding and conclusions. Here we look into detecting lunger cancer tumours which either might be bening or malignant or the lung image may be completely normal. However, such models are large in size which is no longer effective in small devices and consume substantial power or take time when inferencing. We propose model compression techniques such as knowledge distillation and quantization singularly and combined. Below is the table obtained for knowledge distillation on several convolutional neural networks.
